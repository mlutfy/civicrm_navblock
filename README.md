This module allows you to show the CiviCRM menu on non-civicrm pages,
based on paths and permissions of the Drupal block.

After installing the module, a new block called "CiviCRM Menu" will be
available in your Drupal block configuration (/admin/structure/block).
You can use the visiblity options to determine when to display it.

You will probably want to avoid showing on the civicrm* pages, because
CiviCRM will display the menu anyway.
